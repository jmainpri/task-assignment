# task-assignment

This code solves the linear sum assignment problem, also known as minimum weight matching in bipartite graphs.

See the assignment problem:
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assignment_problem)

It is useful for assigning jobs to students depending
on preferences. You can simply define the name and preferences in a yaml file.
WARNING the indices start with one in the yaml file and 0 in the code.
